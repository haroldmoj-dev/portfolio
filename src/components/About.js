      <p className="mb-4">
        I’m currently studying BS Computer Science, Major in Software Technology at De La Salle University (Manila). My journey into tech started in senior high while studying in Bahrain, when a capstone project about cheating prevention made me realize how much I enjoy solving problems through code.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Since then, I’ve learned quite a lot of stuff from basic programming to exploring machine learning. I’m still discovering my niche, but I love the process of building things even on the side. In other words, curiosity drives me, and creativity keeps me going.
      </p>

      <p>
        But of course, I'm human! Outside of coding, I enjoy art, movies, music, and spending time with family. Hopefully, life in the future remains just as fulfilling.
